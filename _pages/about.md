# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, working under the guidance of Prof. Rajesh Chaunsali. My research is driven by a fascination with how we can manipulate the fundamental nature of wave propagation through engineered mechanical systems.

My work sits at the intersection of Solid Mechanics, Topological Physics, and Lattice Dynamics. I am particularly interested in Non-Hermitian systems and Time-Modulated Metamaterials, where the traditional "rules" of reciprocity and energy conservation are intentionally bypassed to achieve unprecedented control over vibrations.
