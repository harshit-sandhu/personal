I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, working under the guidance of Prof. Rajesh Chaunsali. My research is driven by a fascination with how we can manipulate the fundamental nature of wave propagation through engineered mechanical systems.

My work sits at the intersection of Solid Mechanics, Topological Physics, and Lattice Dynamics. I am particularly interested in Non-Hermitian systems and Time-Modulated Metamaterials, where the traditional "rules" of reciprocity and energy conservation are intentionally bypassed to achieve unprecedented control over vibrations.
